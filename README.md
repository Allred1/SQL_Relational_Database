# SQL_Relational_Database
 
# Overview

This program was intended to learn how SQL Relational Databases work, and to get a better idea of how a database is set up, how tables are created and deleted, and how a user can interact with them. 

This simple program creates a database and allows the user to interact with it by creating tables, deleting tables, seeing all the tables, and seeing the contents in each one. 

The purpose for writing this software was to understand how a database works and can be interacted with.
